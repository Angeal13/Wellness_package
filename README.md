You are a Data Scientist for a tourism company named "Visit with us". The Policy Maker of the company wants to enable and establish a viable business model to expand the customer base. One of the ways to expand the customer base is to introduce a new offering of packages. Currently, there are 5 types of packages the company is offering - Basic, Standard, Deluxe, Super Deluxe, King. Looking at the data of the last year, we observed that 18% of the customers purchased the packages. However, the marketing cost was quite high because customers were contacted at random without looking at the available information. The company is now planning to launch a new product.However, this time company wants to harness the available data of existing and potential customers to make the marketing expenditure more efficient.
